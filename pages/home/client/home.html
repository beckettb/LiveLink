			<h3> <i>What we're about:</i> </h3>
			<p>LiveLink is a minimalist platform for finding out what your friends
			or colleagues are up to. Simply enter your status (you can set
			your status to be what you're doing at the moment, or maybe what you'd like to do,) on the links page and it
			will be broadcast to all of your "links" (contacts you've added.) On the
			same page, you can see all of your links and their statuses.
