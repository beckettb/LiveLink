				<h4><i>What we're about:</i></h4>
				<p>LiveLink is a minimalist platform for finding out what your friends
				or colleagues are up to. The site is group based, and the idea is to broadcast your
				current status to everyone in each group you have joined.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="number2">
				<h4><i>How to use the site</i></h4>
				<p>Set your status on the status page along with the username you'd like to appear
				alongside your status. It will automatically be broadcast to all groups you have joined.
				</p>
				<p>You can find existing groups using the "Find groups" page, where you can search for groups
				by either their name or description keyword. To join them simply click on the "Join group"
				button at the bottom of the group information box.</p>
				<p>You're also able to create your own group on the "Create group" page, and your own status
					will be broadcast there. Additionally, your group will be avaialable to find publicly by using the "Find group" page,
					but only members of the group can view the statuses of the group members.</p>

				<h4><i>What we're about:</i></h4>
				<p>LiveLink is a minimalist platform for finding out what your friends
				or colleagues are up to. Simply enter your status (you can set
				your status to be what you're doing at the moment, or maybe what you'd like to do,) on the links page and it
				will be broadcast to all of your "links" (contacts you've added.) On the
				same page, you can see all of your links and their statuses.
